- Create a GET route with the path of '/quote'
- Your callback should reference the responseObj and use an underscore for the requestObj
- Your code block should create a variable randomQuote that is assigned a random string from the quotes array
- Use the responseObj.send method to send an object back with a property of quote that has the value of your randomQuote string
ie. It sends back an object like the one below:
{
  quote: 'JavaScript is the tool that turns ideas into reality.'
}
